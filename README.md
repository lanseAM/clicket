# clicket
Inspired by  hainguyents13's [Mechvibes](https://github.com/hainguyents13/mechvibes), clicket is an app  that plays clicking sounds when you click your mouse. Clicket uses  the ElectronJS framework and React. I made this as a side project because I use Mechvibes all the time and I felt like keyboard sounds just weren't enough.

# Installing
The app is currently only available for windows, but I plan on adding support for more platforms.

**Windows**
To install the app, download the  setup from [releases](https://github.com/spreyo/clicket/releases)  and follow the instructions. 
# Sound Packs
Currently, there are 8 default sound packs pre-installed, but it is possible to add your own packs.

To add a new sound pack, navigate to the ***./sounds*** directory , create a new folder and put the ***click.mp3*** in it. The new sound will then be available after restarting the app.

>   ./sounds/MyCustomPack/click.mp3
