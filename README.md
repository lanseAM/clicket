# clicket
Inspired by  hainguyents13's [Mechvibes](https://github.com/hainguyents13/mechvibes), clicket is an app  that plays clicking sounds when you click your mouse. Clicket uses  the ElectronJS framework and React. I made this as a side project because I use Mechvibes all the time and I felt like keyboard sounds just weren't enough.

# Adding custom sounds
To add a new sound pack, navigate to the ***./sounds*** directory , create a new folder and put the ***click.mp3*** in it.

>   ./sounds/MyCustomPack/click.mp3
